# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Database
Hand Gesture Recognition Database (Acquired by Leap Motion)

About Dataset

Context
Hand gesture recognition database is presented, composed by a set of near infrared images acquired by the Leap Motion sensor.

Content
The database is composed by 10 different hand-gestures (showed above) that were performed by 10 different subjects (5 men and 5 women).

The database is structured in different folders as:
