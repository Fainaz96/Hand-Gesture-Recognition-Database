# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Database
Hand Gesture Recognition Database (Acquired by Leap Motion)

About Dataset

Context
Hand gesture recognition database is presented, composed by a set of near infrared images acquired by the Leap Motion sensor.

Content
The database is composed by 10 different hand-gestures (showed above) that were performed by 10 different subjects (5 men and 5 women).

The database is structured in different folders as:

/00 (subject with identifier 00)
/01_palm (images for palm gesture of subject 00 )
/01_palm/frame_197957_r.png,…,frame_198136_l.png, … (images that corresponds to different samples obtained for the palm gesture performed by the subject with identifier 00)
/02_l (images for l gesture of subject 00 )
/10_down
/01
/02
/09 (last subject with identifier 09)
Every root folder (00, 01,…) contains the infrared images of one subject. The folder name is the identifier of each different subject.
